# __Chapter 5 Labs__

## __Technical requirements__

The following labs will help you deploying a simple demo application using by using some of the commands learned in this chapter. The code for the labs is available in this bookâ€™s Github repository in https://github.com/ PacktPublishing /Docker-for-Developers-Handbook.git. Ensure you have the latest revision available by simply executing git clone https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Docker-for-Developers-Handbook.git to download all its content or git pull if you already downloaded the repository before. 

All commands and content used in these labs will be located inside Docker-for-Developers-Handbook/Chapter5 directory. 

## Deploying a simple demo application

In this lab we will learn how to deploy an application with 3 components: a load balancer, a frontend and a database.
There are hundreds of good docker compose examples and in fact there are many vendors who provide their applications packaged in compose YAML format even for production. We choose this pretty simple application because we are focused in the Docker command-line and not in the application itself.

If you list the content of the Chapter5 folder you will see a forlder containing this simplestapp. There is a folder for each component and a couple of compose files that will allow us deploy the full application.
The compose YAML file that defines our application contains the following code:
```
version: "3.7"

services:
  # load balancer
  lb:
    build: simplestlb
    image: myregistry/simplest-lab:simplestlb
    environment:
      - APPLICATION_ALIAS=simplestapp
      - APPLICATION_PORT=3000
    networks:
      simplestlab:
          aliases:
          - simplestlb
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
  db:
    build: simplestdb
    image: myregistry/simplest-lab:simplestdb
    environment:
        - "POSTGRES_PASSWORD=changeme"
    networks:
       simplestlab:
        aliases:
          - simplestdb
    volumes:
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
  app:
    build: simplestapp
    image: myregistry/simplest-lab:simplestapp
    environment:
      - dbhost=simplestdb
      - dbname=demo
      - dbuser=demo
      - dbpasswd=d3m0
    networks:
       simplestlab:
        aliases:
          - simplestapp
    depends_on:
      - lb
      - db
volumes:
  pgdata:

networks:
  simplestlab:
    ipam:
      driver: default
      config:
        - subnet: 172.16.0.0/16

```

Only one volume will be used, for the database component. The only service published is the load balancer. We have included this service just to let you have an understanding of how we can integrate a multilayer application and only share one visible component.  


Images will be created locally (you may want to upload to your own registry or DockerHub account).
1 - To build all the images for this project we will use docker-compose build:

We could have  directly used docker-compose run to build or pull the images and run all containers, but this way we can review the process step by step.

2 - We can take a look at the images created locally.
```
$ docker image ls
REPOSITORY                TAG           IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
myregistry/simplest-lab   simplestapp   2d88460e20ca   8 minutes ago   73.5MB
myregistry/simplest-lab   simplestdb    e872ee4e9593   8 minutes ago   243MB
myregistry/simplest-lab   simplestlb    bab86a191910   8 minutes ago   8.51MB
```
As you may have noticed all the images created follow the names defined in the compose YAML file. Because build key exists, build process is executed instead of pulling images directly.

3 - Let's now create the container for the database service.
```
$ docker-compose --file simplestlab/docker-compose.yaml --project-name chapter5 create db
[+] Running 3/3
 â ¿ Network chapter5_simplestlab  Created                                                                           0.8s

```
All the objects required for the database service were created. It is not running yet, but it is ready for that.

4 - We run this service alone and review its status.
```
$ docker-compose --file simplestlab/docker-compose.yaml --project-name chapter5 up -d db
[+] Running 1/1
 â ¿ Container chapter5-db-1  Started
```
If you omit the compose or the project's name, we will not get neither the services nor the containers.
```

Your services will quickly change status from Created to Started.

We can now review the status of all our application components and the ports exposed.
```

```

6 - We can scale our app component in this example. This option may be complicated or impossible in other deployments as it really depends on your own application code and logic. For example, you should scale a database component without appropriate database internal scale logic (you should review the database server vendor's documentation).
```
$ docker-compose --file simplestlab/docker-compose.yaml --project-name chapter5 up --scale app=2 -d

## Deploy another project using the same compose YAML file

In this simple example we will review and learn the problems we can have by running two projects using the same compose YAML file.

1 - Let's create a new project by using a new poject name.
```
$ docker-compose --file simplestlab/docker-compose.yaml --project-name newdemo create
[+] Running 0/0
 â ¿ Network newdemo_simplestlab  Error                                                                              0.0s
failed to create network newdemo_simplestlab: Error response from daemon: Pool overlaps with other one on this address space
```

As you may notice, we defined a specific network CIDR for our project network. Docker container runtime assigns IP ranges by using its own IPAM and thus it manages any IP overlap automatically for us. By using a specific range we broke the dynamism of the platform. Let's remove the IP address range from our docker-compose definition:
```
version: "3.7"

services:
  # load balancer
  lb:
    build: simplestlb
    image: myregistry/simplest-lab:simplestlb
    environment:
      - APPLICATION_ALIAS=simplestapp
      - APPLICATION_PORT=3000
    networks:
      simplestlab:
          aliases:
          - simplestlb
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
  db:
    build: simplestdb
    image: myregistry/simplest-lab:simplestdb
    environment:
        - "POSTGRES_PASSWORD=changeme"
    networks:
       simplestlab:
        aliases:
          - simplestdb
    volumes:
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
  app:
    build: simplestapp
    image: myregistry/simplest-lab:simplestapp
    environment:
      - dbhost=simplestdb
      - dbname=demo
      - dbuser=demo
      - dbpasswd=d3m0
    networks:
       simplestlab:
        aliases:
          - simplestapp
    depends_on:
      - lb
      - db
volumes:
  pgdata:

networks:
  simplestlab:
    ipam:
      driver: default
```

2 - And now we try it again.
```
$ docker-compose --file simplestlab/docker-compose.yaml --project-name newdemo create
[+] Running 5/5
 â ¿ Network newdemo_simplestlab  Created                                                                            0.9s

 â ¿ Container newdemo-db-1       Created                                                                            0.2s
 â ¿ Container newdemo-lb-1       Created                                                                            0.2s
 â ¿ Container newdemo-app-1      Created                                                                            0.2s
```

We didn't get any problem now. The volume and network objects were created with the project prefix. We will not be able to reuse the project name because objects names must be unique.

3 - Let's run all the application components now.
```
$ docker-compose --file simplestlab/docker-compose.yaml --project-name newdemo start
[+] Running 1/2
 â ¿ Container newdemo-db-1  Started                                                                                 1.4s

```

You may notice that we also defined a specific port for our __lb__ service. This seems fine for production but defining a specific port in development, where multiple copies of an application can be expected also breaks the dynamism of container-based components. For this to work we could just simply change this port number, allow the system to choose a random one for us or define a variable that will allow us to define a port for each project.

4 - We change our compose YAML and add LB_PORT variable as the port for exposing our application.
```
version: "3.7"

services:
  # load balancer
  lb:
    build: simplestlb
    image: myregistry/simplest-lab:simplestlb
    environment:
      - APPLICATION_ALIAS=simplestapp
      - APPLICATION_PORT=3000
    networks:
      simplestlab:
          aliases:
          - simplestlb
    ports:
      - "${LB_PORT}:80"
  db:
    build: simplestdb
    image: myregistry/simplest-lab:simplestdb
    environment:
        - "POSTGRES_PASSWORD=changeme"
    networks:
       simplestlab:
        aliases:
          - simplestdb
    volumes:
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
  app:
    build: simplestapp
    image: myregistry/simplest-lab:simplestapp
    environment:
      - dbhost=simplestdb
      - dbname=demo
      - dbuser=demo
      - dbpasswd=d3m0
    networks:
       simplestlab:
        aliases:
          - simplestapp
    depends_on:
      - lb
      - db
volumes:
  pgdata:

networks:
  simplestlab:
    ipam:
      driver: default
```

Now we can test again.
```

5 - And we can list the projects deployed in our host along with their number of components.
```
$ docker-compose ls

newdemo             running(3)          /home/frjaraur/labs/Chapter5/simplestlab/docker-compose.yaml
```
With this simple example of usual problems you may find while preparing your applications, we will end this chapterâ€™s labs by removing all the objects created. 

## Removing all projects

```
$ docker volume ls

We will remove manually the volume present for project chapter5, but we will use the --volumes argument for removing all the volumes associated with a project.
